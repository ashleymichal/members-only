# Members Only!

In this project, you'll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

This will be a chance for you to "roll your own" authentication system, very similar to how you did in the tutorial. As usual, we will be focusing on data and function, not style. If you want to add your own stylistic flourishes, consider it extra credit.

It's easy to feel a bit overwhelmed by building your own authentication. That's because there are several moving parts -- the session controller/form, hanging onto and refreshing the remember token when necessary, and using that token to check up on the current user. It may help if you write out the steps as you understand them prior to getting started, so you know what you're shaky on and will need to pay attention to.
